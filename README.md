## Skills
### Problem solving
My background in finance has equipped me with a passion for coming up with tackling challenges in an efficient manner. During my time at Makers Academy, there were numerous occasions where my problem solving was tested. An example of this was during our final project, a problem arose when we were trying to figure out how to implement the prices of ingredients for our recipe app. I was able to come up with a solution which required the implementation of a web scraper. I managed to solve this problem whilst learning a lot throughout the process.
### Leadership
During my first project at Makers, I was introduced to the idea of using a different team lead every day for a group project by one of my cohort members. I embraced this opportunity to act as a Team Lead by making sure I was well prepared and fully aware of the project overview and objectives, as well as encouraged the use of agile methodologies.
### Team-player
I am an adept team player who has worked in countless teams throughout my times at university, my previous roles and Makers Academy. Therefore as a good team player, I've always ensured that any work I've done has been finished on time and kept to the project schedule. This was documented and evidenced at makers on my final project using Trello where I completed my team and individual tickets in the required time.
